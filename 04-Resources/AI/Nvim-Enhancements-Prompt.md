I like to use the Neovim editor for coding and text editing.

Though I think it looks a little bland.

What is every way possible that I can spice it up and make it a more fun editor to use? While also adding practical features that modern day IDEs use?

- make it sleeker looking
- extra hotkeys like the ability to comment blocks of code, surround text in ()[]{}, etc
- animations
- auto complete
- a very sleek and professional looking color scheme and theme
- other graphics additions
- etc

List off everything you can find to help make my Nvim IDE experience better
