- the most effective way to learn C is to write C programs
- #include uses the preprocessor directive
- the `puts()` function returns EOF
- EOF is a c-macro returns a negative-number if the write actually occurred, and a non-negative integer if the write DID NOT occur
- we can do `puts() == EOF` to determine if it failed or not

- we can use `printf()` instead to print formatted strings
- formatted strings can print numbers and other data types
