## Description
---
**SNIFFY** is a Command Line Interface (CLI) packet-sniffer written by yours truly using the `C` programming language in conjunction with the `Linux Sockets API`. The project was completed in a spanning of two weeks, from `1-23-2026` to `2-3-2026`.

I think generating code with AI is for losers, and I will admit, I have been a loser at times.

But the primary objective for all of my projects is to be as frustrated as possible, because frustration is a very critical ingredient for learning. I truly believe software is an art-form and I hope to one day master it.

So, we're going old school!

Here's a list of books that I went through that were great resources in my journey with this project:

- `Beej's Guide to Network Programming Using Internet Sockets`
- `Effective C - Robert Seacord`
- `C Programming Second Edition For The Absolute Beginner - Michael Vine`
- `Hacking The Art of Exploitation - Jon Erickson`

Anyways, I've written all this before even truly starting the project. This project is (1) in a (5) project series associated to my Computer Network Operations portfolio, also included on my Github.

Raw sockets are a bit of a challenge, because they're written entirely different for almost every system out there! Linux sockets are not identical to Windows sockets as an example, so writing a multi-platform-raw-sockets application is essentially impossible. There are libraries out there using more abstract and "wrapped" stuff to enable compatibility across systems, but I will not be using those. Only expect this tool to work on Linux, and more specifically, I created this tool on a system using `Linux Mint 21.2`.

And as a disclaimer, I am not responsible for whatever you do with this :]
