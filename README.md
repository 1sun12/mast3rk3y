# Description
---

**Mast3rk3y** is an all-inclusive wikipedia designed in the note-taking app, "Obsidian" meant to store the notes and research-efforts of all things code, programming, software design & architecture, algorithms, data structures, program languages, etc...

Every project, every computer concept, every language I learn and the respective notes I take on those things will eventually get stored here (assuming I took the time and effort to do that :'))

From writing a "Hello World!" in C, remembering how to write loops in Lua, various solved and unsolved LeetCode problems, template boiler-plate code, random ideas and projects I want to undertake, and the various books and courses I wish to invest my time in are all contending topics I hope to store here.

This library will constantly evolve, change, and undergo different versions of itself as I make efforts to organize this digital information overtime. The version number is really just a counter of "the Xth time I've refactored this repository to fit my present-day needs".

This library was never meant to be a public shared entity of any kind, but I can totally see myself sharing things from time to time from it. Hello to the reader if you are one of those people!

That's all I have to say on this for now. I will end with a quote here that I suppose summarizes what it's like to study Computer Science...

# Tags and Tagging
---

In order to organize so much "generalized" data, there exists a tagging system. Below is an itemized list of such tags with when and what to tag with each:

- #hallway 
	- This is how I mark Meta files in each respective Hallway. These Meta files contain descriptions or table-of-contents and the like for the respective folders everything is organized in. If you're confused by what a hallway is, the `01-Languages` folder is an example. I'm just referring to these topic folders and calling them that. Sounds more fancy.
- #language/
	- Mark what programming language this note is relevant towards
- #concept/
	- Mark what computer science fundamental this goes over:
	- #concept/algorithm/
		- Mark a note of relevance to a specific algorithm
	- #concept/data-structure
		- Mark a note of relevance to a specific data-structure
	- #concept/architecture
		- Mark a note of relevance to a software architecture
	- #concept/design-pattern
		- Mark a note of relevance to a design-pattern
		#concept/machine-learning 
		- Mark a note of relevance to machine-learning, LLM, AI, etc.
- #project/
	- Mark a note relevant to a current project (or a future one)
	- #project/active
