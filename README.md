### Description
mast3rk3y, is a "all-inclusive" set of notes about the programming fundamentals. Forgot how to write a class in C++? Need a refresher on writing Lambda functions in Python? Well I certaintly keep forgetting and maybe you do too. Such is the purpose of these notes. 

Even though I write this as if I am speaking to other people reading this, I mostly wrote these notes for myself. However if you benefit from em that makes me happy :). 
### Coding Problems
Included in this repository will also be some coding problems with their solutions. Either problems I personally completed on something like Leetcode or good practice for remembering or reinforcing a certain topic, most likely from my schooling.
