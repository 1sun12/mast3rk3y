## Description

**Mast3rk3y** is an all-inclusive wikipedia designed in the note-taking app, "Obsidian" meant to store the notes and research-efforts of all things code, programming, software design & architecture, algorithms, data structures, program languages, etc...

Every project, every computer concept, every language I learn and the respective notes I take on those things will eventually get stored here (assuming I took the time and effort to do that :'))

From writing a "Hello World!" in C, remembering how to write loops in Lua, various solved and unsolved LeetCode problems, template boiler-plate code, random ideas and projects I want to undertake, and the various books and courses I wish to invest my time in are all contending topics I hope to store here.

This library will constantly evolve, change, and undergo different versions of itself as I make efforts to organize this digital information overtime. The version number is really just a counter of "the Xth time I've refactored this repository to fit my present-day needs".

This library was never meant to be a public shared entity of any kind, but I can totally see myself sharing things from time to time from it. Hello to the reader if you are one of those people!

That's all I have to say on this for now. I will end with a quote here that I suppose summarizes what it's like to study Computer Science...

Setting up this repository locally for Obsidian is pretty easy. Here's how you do it:

## Two README(s)
---

There exist (2) seperate README(s), both are important and here's why:
- You are currently reading one of them! This is the `Github` compatible one.
- If you choose to install this repository locally to your own `Obsidian` client, you are intended to head on over to `README-OBSIDIAN`, which has more details, tagging, links, etc all that `Obsidian` compatible jazz.
